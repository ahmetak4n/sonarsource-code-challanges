# sonarsource-code-challanges
SonarSource has a vulnerability calendar. You can find a lot of vulnerable code snippet relate to up-to-date vulnerabilities on java, php, javascript, etc. You can access the challange via https[:]//www[.]sonarsource[.]com/knowledge/code-challenges/advent-calendar-2022/

I just developed small applications that include vulnerabilities mentioned by SonarSource. With this way you can run and verify vulnerabilities piece by piece.
